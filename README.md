## ü§î Inspiration and üòñ Pain points
The health and environmental impact of the coal industry for electricity includes issues such as land use, waste management, water, and air pollution, caused by coal mining, processing, and the use of its products. In addition to atmospheric pollution, coal burning produces hundreds of millions of tons of solid waste products annually, including fly ash, bottom ash, and flue-gas desulfurization sludge, which contains mercury, uranium, thorium, arsenic, and other heavy metals. Coal is the largest contributor to the human-made increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. There are severe health effects caused by burning coal. According to a report by the World Health Organization in 2008, coal particulates pollution is estimated to shorten approximately 10,000 lives annually worldwide.

Around the world, more than enough food is produced to feed the global population‚Äîbut more than 690 million people still go hungry. After steadily declining for a decade, world hunger is on the rise, affecting 8.9 percent of people globally. From 2018 to 2019, the number of undernourished people grew by 10 million, and there are nearly 60 million more undernourished people now than in 2014. One in four people in Nepal lives below the national poverty line - which is just US$50 cents per day - so many struggles to feed themselves and their families. Nepal‚Äôs vulnerability to high food prices, especially in remote mountain areas, drives hunger. Average food prices in the mountain and hill regions are over 100 percent higher than in other locations.

While employment generation is a medium- to long-term concern, more urgent is sustaining agricultural production, ensuring a fair price for farmers, and access to the market. The climate and soil of Nepal are fertile and productive, but past neglect, the drift of educated youth away from the land, and now the climate crisis has affected agriculture production. Across Nepal, fields, and terraces are barren or are reverting to the jungle. The elderly are left managing the farm, while others move to the roadhead for schooling, or living off remittance. In the Tarai, once Nepal‚Äôs grain basket, agricultural activity is affected by urbanization, salination, and depletion of groundwater.


## ‚úÖ How we can help 

We can use solar energy which is a renewable resource by using unused land and terraces of houses and buildings which shows the potential of solar energy as a viable power source for improving education and quality of life in remote rural villages in Nepal.

To use a photovoltaic system for lighting in rural areas and the surrounding community ‚Ä¢ To provide clean, portable small solar home systems for students and residents, significantly reducing the emission of toxic gases from the current use of kerosene lamps

The acceptability of photovoltaic technology in rural Nepal is high. The government of Nepal and many international donors have supported more than 250,000 households in rural Nepal to install similar solar home systems in previous energy drives.

The livelihoods of more than 13 million Nepalese are dependent on farming small terraced plots in remote hilly and mountainous regions where crop yields are low and food insecurity is high. The narrow terraces require planting and weeding by hand ‚Äî time-consuming and tedious work that typically falls to women. We can provide unused lands and terraces of houses and buildings to these farmers where they can farm without risking their lives.


## üåü Features of our platform

People can rent their land and terraces for rooftop farming and solar power mini farms by just clicking a few pictures and mentioning some details.
Generating an income which may help people to cut-off some electricity and food expenses can be achieved.
Searching for the nearest location where land is available for terrace farming and small solar plants becomes possible.
Many who are deprived of work due to this pandemic will get work.


## üòäProblems we will be solving.

- Hunger
- Pollution
- Access to electricity
- Unemployment

## Solar Project Calculations and Business Aspects

Solar power plants, be they on rooftops or on the ground, require significant area. While solar power has some critical sustainability advantages over fossil-based thermal power.
 
A simple rule of thumb is to take 100 sq ft for every 1kW of solar panels.
